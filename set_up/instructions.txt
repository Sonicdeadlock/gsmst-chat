Run the database_setup.sql on that database
Install NodeJS on the server
Run the Node package install in the directory that you downloaded the server files to. (there should be a node_modules folder in the same folder as the nodejs folder)

	a.mysql - the information for the mysql database
	b.mail - The email user that the mail is sent from
	c.dir - the absolute directory of the public folder
